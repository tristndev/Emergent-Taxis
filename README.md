# EmergentTaxis

A javascript visualization for Emergent Taxis (a swarm of low-capable robots finds a light source)

## What is *Emergence*?

Emergence describes 'how stupid things get smart together' (after a great [kurzgesagt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE)).
Think: A single ant is not capable of much, but a whole ant colony can achieve impressive things.

## What is *Emergent Taxis*?

We will observe a swarm of minimalist, low-capable robots slowly moving towards a light source. Each individual agent is not capable of doing so, but together they can locate the light (hence the *emergent*).
